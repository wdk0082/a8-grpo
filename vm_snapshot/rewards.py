"""Reward functions for GRPO on GSM8K.

Reward shaping rationale
------------------------
Pure correctness reward is very sparse: the model must produce a parseable
number AND get it right. Early in training it does neither, so the gradient
signal is near-zero. We add cheap shaping rewards that are non-zero almost
immediately:

  1. match_format_exactly        — full template match  (large, sparse)
  2. match_format_approximately  — count of expected tags (dense, easy)
  3. check_answer                — exact / close / wrong numeric match
  4. check_numbers               — fallback that just extracts a number

The total per-rollout reward is the sum across all four. GRPO then normalises
this within the group of G rollouts to compute the advantage. This is the
"group-relative" part of GRPO: no value network is learned; advantages come
from comparing siblings drawn from the same prompt.
